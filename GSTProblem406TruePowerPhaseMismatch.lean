# Why local U-positivity alone cannot close the pure-power 3-step collision

This is an EXACT, ORIGINAL FOUR-POWER experiment, not a synthetic source.
At K=8, the child 4^8 has a Happy cell at p=4, and 4^11 has
NO Happy cells at rows p=3 or 4, yet:
  child phase prefix at b=3, H=2 = +2,
  parent phase prefix at b=3, H=2 = -4,
  exact unified U derivative at p=4 = +518.

All of these are direct consequences of the actual GST graph.
They are CONSISTENT. Therefore local source phase>0, local
right phase<=0, and positive GST U derivative do not contradict
each other, even on literal 4^K. The right parent later has a
real Happy at p=10, so this does not refute the full theorem.
