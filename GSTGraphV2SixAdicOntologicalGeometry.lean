# GST Graph V2 Six-Adic Ontological Geometry

This file adds a six-adic resolution layer to the existing GST Graph V2
non-Euclidean ontology.  It does not add an eighth ontological axis: the
seven-axis vertex ontology is left intact, while six-adic congruence supplies
a resolution relation on integer-valued energy charts.

The base six is used as a synchronized dyadic/triadic resolution scale.  The
core relation is deliberately stated as exact divisibility rather than by a
real-valued metric, so the layer can be used without introducing analytic
completions into the finite GST graph.
