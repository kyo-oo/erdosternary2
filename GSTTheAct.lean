# THE ACT — the exact missing object, named once (base module)

The base of the climb-family stack, extracted so that every module above
it (the diagonal read, the completed prefaced read, the cascade, the
collapse) can build on these objects without circularity:

* **§0 THE ACT.**  `the_act` names the exact object whose absence is the
  whole conditionality of `hTailF`: the even-exponent statement
  `∀ K ≥ 8, noTernaryTwo (4^K) = false`.  `the_act_iff_hTailF`: through the
  repo's own green unconditional iff, the act and `hTailF`'s target are ONE
  object — whatever proves the act proves `hTailF`, and nothing weaker
  than the act does.

* **§1 THE ANSWER.  Erdős closed ⇒ hTailF closed.**
  `hTailF_of_full_erdos`: if the full ternary statement
  (`∀ n ≥ 9, noTernaryTwo (2^n) = false`) is proven — by boss, by any
  construction, inside this repo or outside it — then `hTailF` closes in
  ONE line through this green bridge.  `the_act_iff_full_erdos`: the act
  and the full statement are one object, because the repo's own
  odd-exponent half is already green.  `climb_gives_the_act`: the climb,
  the input `hTailF` currently consumes, carries strictly MORE than the
  act (the pair demand: digit two with x4-carry zero or three) — the
  conditional route through the climb is overkill, not necessity.

* **§2 THE FRONT LAW.**  At the valuation cut `v`, row `v+1` of
  `4^(3^v·a)` is exactly `a % 3`: the power-of-four ternary digit stream
  reads the reduced exponent trit directly — the zeroth level of the
  diagonal read, the seed of the whole ladder above it.

/-! ## §0 THE ACT — the exact missing object, named once -/

/-- THE ACT: every `4^K` from `K = 8` onward owns a ternary digit two.
This is the exact content whose absence is the whole conditionality of
`hTailF` — no more, no less. -/

proves `hTailF`, and nothing weaker than the act does. -/

/-- **THE ANSWER.  Erdős closed ⇒ hTailF closed, one green line.**
If the full ternary statement is proven anywhere — by boss, by any
construction, inside this repo or outside it — `hTailF` closes through
this bridge.  The conditionality of `hTailF` is exactly the act, not the
climb: the climb is overkill. -/

  the_act_iff_hTailF.mp (the_act_of_full_erdos hFull)

/-- The act plus the repo's green odd-exponent half and the verified
below-floor instances assemble the FULL ternary statement. -/

    · exact h K hK8

half is already green, so the even half is the whole remaining content. -/

    the_act ↔ (∀ n : Nat, 9 ≤ n → noTernaryTwo (2^n) = false) :=
  ⟨full_erdos_of_the_act, the_act_of_full_erdos⟩

/-- The climb carries strictly more than the act: whoever proves the
climb proves the act (the pair demand subsumes digit-two existence).
The climb is an overkill route to `hTailF`, not a necessity. -/

/-- **THE FRONT LAW.**  At the valuation cut `v`, row `v+1` of `4^(3^v * a)`
is exactly `a % 3`: the power-of-four ternary digit stream reads the
reduced exponent trit directly.  Built on the repo's own green laws —
the exact LTE identity and the one-digit exponent lift. -/
