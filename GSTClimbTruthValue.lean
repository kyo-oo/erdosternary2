# THE CLIMB'S TRUTH VALUE — why `hTailF` is conditional, machine-certified

One separate file, zero monolith bytes.  It answers the standing question
with machine-checked theorems instead of words:

**Why is `hTailF` conditional?  Is `four_power_happy_climb` false?  Is the
Erdős conjecture proven?**

* **§1 THE CONDITIONALITY CERTIFICATE.**  `climb_implies_erdos`: whoever
  proves the climb proves the even-exponent Erdős ternary statement
  (`∀ K ≥ 8, noTernaryTwo (4^K) = false`), through the repo's own green
  chain — `hTailF` consumes the climb, the green unconditional iff
  `erdos_even_conjecture_iff_tailF` converts tailF into the statement.
  `erdos_ternary_full_of_climb`: the climb, plus the repo's own green
  odd-exponent half (`erdos_ternary_2_conjecture_odd`) and the verified
  instances below the floor, assembles the FULL Erdős ternary statement
  (`∀ n ≥ 9, noTernaryTwo (2^n) = false`).  The single hypothesis of
  `hTailF` is therefore not a lemma — it carries the entire remaining
  content of the conjecture.  What is green in the repo is the BRIDGE
  (the iff, both directions), not the endpoint: removing the hypothesis
  means proving the Erdős ternary conjecture itself.
* **§2 THE FLOOR WITNESS.**  At `K = 7` the conjecture HOLDS (`4^7`
  owns ternary digit twos) while the climb FAILS (no Happy row at any
  position `p ≥ 3`).  The climb is the PAIR demand — a digit two whose
  x4-carry is zero or three — which is strictly stronger than digit-two
  existence.  That is why the climb's floor is exactly eight.
* **§3 THE CLIMB IS NOT FALSE.**  It owns explicit Happy rows at its
  floor and beyond: `K = 8` (row 4, carry 0), `K = 9` (row 7, carry 3),
  `K = 10` (row 10, carry 3).  A bounded scan of the whole interval
  `[8, 5000]` (accompanying receipt `scripts/climb_truth_scan.py`;
  the worldtrace had certified `[8, 1500]`) finds zero counterexamples:
  the climb is true at every exponent any machine has checked.  The
  "prove it false" branch is empty.
* **§4 THE RECEIPT.**  One theorem assembling every face, with axiom
  printouts: every theorem here rests on the classical three only.

/-- At `K = 7` there is NO Happy row at any position `p ≥ 3`: the climb
fails below its floor.  Above the ternary length of `4^7` the digit is
zero, so only the six positions `3..8` need checking; each is closed by
`decide`, and every position `≥ 9` dies because `4^7 < 3^9 ≤ 3^p`
makes the digit identically zero. -/
