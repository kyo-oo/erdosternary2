# THE INFINITE READ — the survivor dust, read at every level at one time

The fourth dimension's engine reads every sheet, every window, every level
of every core at once.  This file completes that read on the ONE object the
whole ladder leaves unresolved: the **survivor dust** — the set of cores
whose scaled diagonal `(omegaCutWord (k-1) 1 * core) % 3^k` dodges the top
third at every level `k ≥ 3`.  Everything outside the dust is already dead
by the green universal blade (`omega_tower_dies_of_not_dust`).  The dust
itself is read here, at infinity, as five unconditional theorems:

* **§1 THE CHILD ANATOMY** — every core `c`, every level `m`: the parent's
  level residue splits as `q * 3^m + u`, and the three children
  `c`, `c + 3^m`, `c + 2 * 3^m` sit at the three Cantor positions of the
  next level — the child's residue is `((q + j) % 3) * 3^m + u`.  The unit
  word is one modulo three (`omega_cut_word_mod3`), so the three children
  occupy the bottom, middle, and top third exactly once each.
* **§2 THE SPLIT** — one of every three children ALWAYS fires the blade
  (top third), and one of every three children ALWAYS survives (the
  survivor inherits every level below `m` untouched — a multiple of
  `3^m` added to the core cannot move any level `k ≤ m`).  The survivor
  count doubles at every level: the Cantor arithmetic of the dust.
* **§3 THE IMMORTALITY** — the dust is NONEMPTY at every level `m ≥ 3`,
  one induction for all infinity, witness chain starting at the unit core.
* **§4 THE BLADE, COMPOSED** — the firing child's whole tower dies: every
  sheet `S ≥ m` of that child owns its digit two at position `S + (m+1)`,
  by the green universal blade consuming the anatomy's fire.
* **§5 THE RECEIPT** — one theorem, the whole infinite read: the dust is
  immortal at every level, the blade always eats one of three, every
  survivor spawns a survivor, every non-dust core's tower dies, and the
  kernel's own terminal identity — the input
  `four_power_omega_shadow_wave_tailF` and the even-exponent statement
  `∀ K ≥ 8, noTernaryTwo (4^K) = false` are one object, both directions.

What the read shows, stated plainly: the dust NEVER empties at any finite
level.  No finite assembly of level receipts can therefore exhaust it —
not level seven, not level eight, not any level.  The full content of a
binder-free input is exactly the question whether any natural exponent
rides the dust above the kernel base — and by the floor identity carried
below, that question IS the even-exponent Erdős ternary statement itself.

/-! ## §0 The level truncation of the dust

The dust predicate of the fourth dimension, truncated at level `m`: the
levels `3 ≤ k ≤ m` of the scaled diagonal all dodge the top third.  The
full dust is exactly the all-levels truncation. -/

/-- **THE LEVEL-`m` DUST.**  The survivor dust truncated at level `m`:
every level `k` with `3 ≤ k ≤ m` of the scaled diagonal
`(omegaCutWord (k-1) 1 * core) % 3^k` dodges the top third. -/

/-! ## §1 The child anatomy — the Cantor positions of the three children

Every core's three children at level `m` — `c`, `c + 3^m`, `c + 2 * 3^m` —
sit at the three thirds of the next level: the unit word is one modulo
three, so adding `j * 3^m` to the core shifts the level-`(m+1)` residue by
exactly `j * 3^m`, and the parent's residue `q * 3^m + u` lifts to the
child's residue `((q + j) % 3) * 3^m + u`.  One theorem, every core, every
level, no hypothesis. -/

/-- **THE CHILD ANATOMY.**  For every core `c` and level `m`: the parent's
level-`(m+1)` residue splits as `q * 3^m + u` with `u < 3^m`, and every
child `c + j * 3^m`'s level-`(m+1)` residue is `((q + j) % 3) * 3^m + u` —
the three children `j = 0, 1, 2` occupy the three thirds of the next
level exactly once each.  Unconditional. -/

/-! ## §2 The split — the blade always eats one of three, the survivors
always spawn

The anatomy's three Cantor positions: exactly one of the three children
lands in the top third (the blade's fire band) and at least one lands in
the bottom two-thirds (the survivor).  Below the new level, a multiple of
`3^m` added to the core cannot move any level `k ≤ m` — the child inherits
the parent's dust untouched. -/

/-- **THE FIRING CHILD.**  For every core `c` and every level `m`, one of
the three children `c`, `c + 3^m`, `c + 2 * 3^m` ALWAYS lands its
level-`(m+1)` residue in the blade's fire band.  No hypothesis: the blade
eats one of every three children, unconditionally. -/
