# GST exact first row-two collision along the physical four-power orbit

This is a source-specific first-hit theorem, not an all-row global gate.
Using the existing exact period 3^2 = 9 of physical ternary row 2,
it determines the LEAST shift j >= 0 for which the original neighbors
4^(K+j) and 4^(K+j+1) have a shared ternary digit two at row 2.

The exact table for K mod 9 = 0,...,8 is
    5,4,3,2,1,0,0,7,6.

In particular, a first row-two hit occurs by shift six if and only if
K mod 9 != 7. The distinguished residue seven needs exactly seven
shifts AT THIS ROW; this does not assert that earlier hits at higher
rows do not exist. All results are binder-free and axiom-free.
