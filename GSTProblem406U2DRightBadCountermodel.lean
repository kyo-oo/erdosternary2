# Exact U2D right-BAD / positive-rectangle countermodel

This is an adversarial check of one proposed proof shortcut,
NOT a counterexample to the original CommonTwo theorem.

The positive source A=55 satisfies A mod 27 = 1.  Its own
source-neighbor pair has a genuine Happy digit 2 at row 3.
The right source after horizontal width N=3 is 55*4^3=3520,
which has NO shared digit 2 with 4*3520 at ANY ternary row,
including row zero.  However the exact x4-by-3 weighted
crossing sum through row 3 is POSITIVE, equal to 41661.

Therefore right-boundary all-depth BADness alone does NOT
force the left-to-right full U2D rectangle weighted sum <=0.
Any proposed universal proof using that sign transfer must
supply an additional canonical perfect-power-specific
interior constraint. All statements here are exact arithmetic.
