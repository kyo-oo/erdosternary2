# DeepMind Problem 406 — comparator challenge

This is the question-side Lean file for the official comparator harness.
It states the Erdős ternary-2 problem exactly in the benchmark surface:
for every exponent `n ≥ 9`, the ternary expansion of `2^n` contains digit `2`.

The `sorry` below is intentional on the challenge side only.  The solution file
must provide the proof, importing the green monolith.

  else if n % 3 = 2 then false
  else noTernaryDigitTwo (n / 3)
