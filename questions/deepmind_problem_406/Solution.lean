# Erdős Problem 406 — ternary powers of two

Fresh comparator solution against the repaired, compatibility-preserving production monolith.
The exported theorem is zero-input: the exact residual Ω termination theorem is
live and kernel-compiled, supplies residual Navigation, and closes the unconditional even wing.
This file is intentionally minimal so the official Challenge/Solution comparator audits the
public theorem surface rather than a duplicated proof script.
