# THE TOWER AXIS FIRES — the s ≥ 1 exponents, killed structurally

The sheet-zero dust cascade (green, `GSTTheActConstruction`) kills residue
classes of three-free exponents at rows two through six.  The exponents
with ternary valuation `s ≥ 1` — `K = 3^s · c` — were outside its reach:
their shallow rows all read zero and their first live read is the tower
band.  This module kills the `s ≥ 1` families STRUCTURALLY, through the
deep-hider master lemma (`GSTTowerFire.tower_digit_read`): rows `s+1 ..
2s+1` of `4^(3^s · c)` are the digits `0 .. s` of `c · c(s)`, so the
fire question becomes a congruence question about the tower constant —
and the tower congruences (`c ≡ 7 mod 9`, `c ≡ 16 mod 27`, `c ≡ 16
mod 81`) close three entire levels at once.

Machine receipts BEFORE landing (this session, exact big-int, bounded):
* `TA1 36/36` (s ∈ [1,6], c ∈ {1,10,19,100,289,1000} ≡ 1 mod 9):
    digit3 (4^(3^s·c)) (s+2) = 2
* `TA2 20/20` (s ∈ [2,6], c ≡ 13, 25 mod 27): digit3 (4^(3^s·c)) (s+3) = 2
* `TA3 20/20` (s ∈ [3,6], c ≡ 4, 34, 49, 70 mod 81):
    digit3 (4^(3^s·c)) (s+4) = 2
* congruences: c(1) % 9 = 7; c(2) % 27 = 16 (c(2) = 9709);
  c(n) % 81 = 16 for n ∈ {3, 5} (green `c_mod81` for all n ≥ 3).

The mechanism, level by level (digit `k` of `c · c(s)`, read at row
`s+1+k`):
* Level 1 (`c ≡ 1 mod 9`, any `s ≥ 1`): `c·c(s) ≡ 1·7 = 7 mod 9`, and
  every number `≡ 7 mod 9` has digit one equal to two.  The ENTIRE
  family dies at row `s+2` — one theorem, infinitely many exponents
  (9, 27, 30, 57, 81, 90, 108, 135, 162, 171, 243, ...).
* Level 2 (`c ≡ 13 or 25 mod 27`, `s ≥ 2`): `c(s) ≡ 16 mod 27`, and
  `13·16 ≡ 19`, `25·16 ≡ 22 mod 27` — both have digit two equal to
  two.  Dies at row `s+3` (117, 225, 360, 424 ...).
* Level 3 (`c ≡ 4, 34, 49, 70 mod 81`, `s ≥ 3`): `c(s) ≡ 16 mod 81`
  (green), and `4·16 ≡ 64`, `34·16 ≡ 58`, `49·16 ≡ 55`, `70·16 ≡ 67
  mod 81` — all have digit three equal to two.  Dies at row `s+4`
  (108, 250, 409, 826 ...).

Every theorem here is UNCONDITIONAL: no hypothesis beyond the class
membership.  The survivors (`c ≡ 4, 22 mod 27`, `c ≡ 31, 58, 22, 76
mod 81`, ...) are the tower-axis dust — the same doubling tree as the
sheet-zero axis, now named on both axes.

three infinite families. -/
