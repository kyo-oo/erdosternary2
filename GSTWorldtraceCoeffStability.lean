# Unconditional stabilization of GST Worldtrace LTE coefficients

The coefficient c_s from 4^(3^s)=1+3^(s+1)*c_s stabilizes on
every fixed finite ternary band as the scale s increases. This
identifies the exact finite truncations of the GST worldtrace limit
without postulating any convergence axiom.
