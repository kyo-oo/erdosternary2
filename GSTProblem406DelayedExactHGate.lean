# Exact arbitrarily delayed FIRST simultaneous GST source-neighbor gate

Existing GST Worldtrace work proved an arbitrarily late FIRST SOURCE
two for normalized multiplier u=2 mod3. A genuine source-neighbor
statement requires proving that 4^(K+1) also carries two at THAT
SAME row; here it is derived directly from the exact one-trit physical
Worldtrace block law. This proves first CommonTwo time = L+1.

Thus there can be no universal constant prefix-scan bound for the
unconditional hGate goal: every finite horizon is missed by some
true original physical perfect-power pair, even though the pair
eventually has its exact first common two. This is a genuine,
noncircular infinite-range geometric constraint on proof search.
