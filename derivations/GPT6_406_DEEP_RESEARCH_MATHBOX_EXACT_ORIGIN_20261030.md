# GST Problem 406 — Mathbox/Deep Research exact-origin proof attempt (2026-10-30)

**Starting revision**: `e304d61c588f8bc264a87102c5e9ad521d633aaf` (direct hGate audit).
**Research branch**: `gpt6/problem406-exact-origin-gate-research-20261030`.
**Authoritative goal**: no new axioms, no `sorry`, prove for every `K>=5, K!=7`
`CommonTwo K`, i.e. one SAME positive base-3 row has value 2 in
`4^K` and `4^(K+1)`. The final benchmark is still conditional on
`gst_four_power_third_wave_gate`; do not change production until
that exact proposition has a binder-free kernel proof.

## New verified arithmetic from Deep Research

`GSTProblem406BinaryOriginExponentScale.lean` now includes
`physicalBinaryThreshold`, `physical_source_exact_binary_threshold`
and `physical_scales_at_three_step`. These are universal exact
arithmetic identities, independent of the universal gate:

For K>=13, let L(K)=floor((4K-1)/3) and t(K)=floor(3L(K)/2)+1.
Then

| K mod 3 | L(K) | t(K) | 4^K |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| K=3q | 4q-1 | 6q-1 | 2^(t+1) |
| K=3q+1 | 4q+1 | 6q+2 | 2^t |
| K=3q+2 | 4q+2 | 6q+4 | 2^t |

And L(K+3)=L(K)+4; t(K+3)=t(K)+6.

**Calibration**: the identity identifies the original source in
binary units. It does NOT exclude any actual BAD exponent and does
NOT itself solve the hGate. Stating a new lemma that these exact
binary values cannot be BAD would be merely renaming the goal.

## Signed U2D rectangle: explicit negative discriminator

Existing strict audit:
`derivations/GPT6_DIRECT_HGATE_GST_KERNEL_OBLIGATIONS_20261030.md`
shows the right-BAD-to-full-rectangle sign implication is missing.

The new `GSTProblem406U2DRightBadCountermodel.lean`
constructs a concrete physical x4 source-neighbor matrix with
source A=55 and horizontal width N=3:

- A mod 27=1 (same initial low-prefix form as a canonical cut).
- The left edge A=55 and 4A=220 have a common digit two at p=3.
- The right edge 4^3 A=3520 and 4^4 A=14080 has **no common
  digit 2 at any ternary row p>=0**, not merely a finite sample.
  Proof: exact inspection for p<8, and 3520<3^8 for p>=8.
- The full GST crossing charge
  `weightedCrossPrefix demoCarry demoDigit 3 4`
  is **+41661 > 0** by the full exact 12-cell cross-density table,
  with demoDigit(t,p)=digit3(55*4^t,p) and
  demoCarry(t,p)=floor(4*(55*4^t mod3^p)/3^p).

This is a counterexample to the **generic**
`right all-depth BAD => weightedCrossPrefix <=0`
transport argument (even with A mod27=1). It is **not** a
counterexample to the original theorem: 55 is not a power 4^K.

An independent WolframLanguageEvaluator computation reproduced
all digits and the exact 41661 weighted sum. Strict Lean kernel validation and #print-axioms audit **PASS**:
https://github.com/kyo-oo/erdosternary2/actions/runs/41021108173 .

## What the new countermodel says about the actual GST proof

The **canonical** rectangle in
`GSTFinalPrefixOneDirectU2DCollision.lean` is NOT an arbitrary
integer A. Definitions in
`GSTGraphV2HandwrittenOmegaUBlock.lean` give

```text
residualEnergy s 1 n = 4^(3^(s+1)*n),
residualWidth s = 3^s,
parent exponent = 3^s*(1+3*n).
```

Thus a valid signed-rectangle solution must derive a new,
specific constraint on the interior `reverseSurviveCode`
and terminal carry/digit potentials from exactly this
perfect-power source. A proof using only the generic 12-cell
sign table, right-BAD inequality and a zero lower-left carry
cannot work; the explicit countermodel satisfies all three
of those weaker ingredients.

The exact direct statement that would finish this
canonical propagation route is still UNPROVED:

```text
for s>=1,n>=1:
  if the canonical left source 4^(3^(s+1)*n) has a Happy row
  then the right source 4^(3^s*(1+3n)) has a Happy row.
```

It must be established from GST source identities and the full
nonlinear interior, without assuming the desired right witness.

## Fixed binary modulus obstruction to proposed finite product states

Any claim that storing only (carry, source residue mod 64)
eliminates all BAD sources is false, even for arbitrarily
deep ternary words. Let m=2^j for j>=1 and

```text
R_j = (3^(2^j)-1)/2 = 1+3+...+3^(2^j-1).
```

Every base-3 digit of R_j is 1, so R_j and 4R_j
cannot have a COMMON digit 2. By the 2-adic LTE formula

```text
v_2(3^(2^j)-1) = j+2,
v_2(R_j) = j+1.
```

This gives BAD integers with binary valuation as high as
desired. The ratio v_2(R_j)/ternary length = (j+1)/2^j
decreases to 0, so these examples do NOT refute the much
stronger proposed barrier v_2(R)>1.5*L; instead they show
a fixed 64-state tag cannot capture the **growing**
binary-vs-ternary constraint that the actual power 4^K
satisfies. Exact finite checks were independently
run with Wolfram for j=1..8.

## Remaining original theorem — no hypothesis promotion

Even after the new Lean-verified arithmetic identities,
the core `gst_four_power_third_wave_gate` remains
equivalent to the universal quantified `CommonTwo`
assertion. The all-source valuation-barrier
proposed previously remains an unproved conjecture;
4,812,489 checks through L=240 are not a proof.
A fixed ternary prefix/residue-class classification and
a finite-state binary tag alone do not yield the missing
origin-specific all-scale contradiction.

**Status:** strict exact-origin arithmetic proved, strict U2D
countermodel kernel check passed;
U2D generic sign closure refuted by exact integer data;
the original universal Problem 406 theorem remains open
in the checked Lean proof tree. Production untouched.
