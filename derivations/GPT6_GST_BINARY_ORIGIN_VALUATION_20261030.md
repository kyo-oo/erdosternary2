# Erdős 406 — GST binary-origin / ternary-survivor dual-scale research

**Branch:** `gpt6/problem406-binary-origin-valuation-20261030`  
**Original production target:** `∀ K ≥ 5, K ≠ 7, CommonTwo K`.  
**Comparator unchanged:** no new hGate premise, no custom axiom, no source substitution.

## 1. Why this is a different mathematical route

Earlier routes exploit ternary carry-state exclusion, GST Worldtrace nonlinearity,
3-adic exponent isometry, exact archimedean phase windows, and all-scale physical
coefficient identities. Alone they never use the full *binary terminal order*
of the original literal power source `4^K`.

This route couples three data of the SAME physical integer simultaneously:
1. source multiplicative identity `R = 4^K = 2^(2K)`;
2. all-row GST no-common carry automaton for `R -> 4R`;
3. exact finite ternary source endpoint.

A complete theorem must rule out the joint three-way configuration
for every K>=13, then use directly checked K=5,6,8,...,12, with K=7 excluded.

## 2. New global Lean-verified source theorem

The new module `GSTProblem406BinaryOriginExponentScale.lean` proves
unconditionally for **every natural K >= 13**:

```text
L(K) := (4K-1)/3,
4^K < 3^L(K),
3*L(K) < 4*K,
2^((3*L(K))/2 + 1) divides 4^K,
p >= L(K) -> digit3(4^K,p)=0.
```

The universal proof comes from the exact recurrence over exponent increments
of three, `4^(K+3) = 4^K*4^3` and `L(K+3)=L(K)+4`, with
`4^3 = 64 < 81 = 3^4`; the three bases K=13,14,15 are exact
natural-integer computations. No hGate, surrogate source or completion axiom
is used, and the source is the literal original `4^K`.

**Strict isolated Lean kernel CI PASS:**

This improves the earlier unconditional physical endpoint
`2(K+1)+1` to `(4K-1)/3` when K>=13.

## 3. Direct remaining mathematical implication (not postulated)

For any integer R>0 define BAD(R) to mean no positive row p with
`digit3(R,p)=digit3(4R,p)=2`. Define `L` an upper ternary cutoff.

A potentially sufficient **new lemma to PROVE** (not an axiom) is:

```text
For every L >= 10 and every positive integer R < 3^L,
if R % 3 = 1 and 2^(floor(3L/2)+1) divides R,
then NOT BAD(R).
```

Together with the already *proved* physical-source theorem this would
produce a genuine original `CommonTwo K` for every K>=13, and
the explicitly checked K=5,6,8,9,10,11,12 close the remaining cases.

However, the proposed lemma is strictly **stronger** than the required
physical-power target, because it quantifies over arbitrary R with the
same binary/ternary magnitude constraints, not just literal powers 4^K.
Failure to prove this stronger lemma is not proof of failure of the
original hGate. NEVER substitute this proposed lemma as an assumption
into `Solution.lean`, `ErdosTernary2.lean`, or a custom axiom.
Try to derive it from GST cross-radix dynamics; if disproved, restrict
to the actual powers 4^K and continue.

## 4. Exact broad falsification test

`scripts/gst_406_binary_origin_valuation_audit.py` exhaustively enumerates
ALL positive R satisfying the three premises within
`10 <= L <= 240`, using

```text
t = floor(3L/2) + 1
R = q*2^t
0 < q*2^t < 3^L
q mod3 = (-1)^t mod3 .
```

This is an exhaustive arithmetic parametrization of the selected class,
not sampled exponents. A 4-state GST carry algorithm checks all rows,
and an independent literal-power digit implementation is exhaustively
cross-checked for all 1<=R<3^8 before the main run.

**Exact tested candidates: 4,812,489.**  
**Proposed-lemma violations: 0 within L=10,...,240.**  
**Strict GitHub Actions script receipt PASS:**
https://github.com/kyo-oo/erdosternary2/actions/runs/40970465209

Independent Wolfram check for L=10,...,30:
15 candidates, zero violations. Independent Wolfram checks on the genuinely
BAD non-power source `R=76490824921120768` confirm:
base-3 length 36, binary valuation 46, no shared positive-position
ternary two in R and 4R. This illustrates that BAD sources DO exist,
just not among those with valuation greater than 3/2 of their ternary cut
in the tested range.

**Finite testing does not establish the quantified lemma for L>240.**

## 5. Exact source of novelty and the open mechanism

Prior global archimedean restriction
`8R <= 7(9^m-1)` is sharp for generic BAD ternary words;
density/spectral bounds cannot exclude even one specific natural exponent,
and arbitrary finite bad ternary prefixes have real perfect-power mimics.

The binary endpoint theorem adds a *different*, physical cross-radix invariant:
high binary valuation alongside the *full ternary terminal word*.
For L=2m, the proposed barrier says no positive number
`R=2*q*8^m < 9^m`, `R==1 (mod3)`, survives all GST pair-collision
rows, once m>=5. The leading factor 2 is required because the binary
valuation threshold is `3m+1`. Its multiplier satisfies
`2q < (9/8)^m`.

A rigorous length-uniform theorem must now link
2-adic divisibility to the complete GST four-state carry recurrence
and exclude a high-valuation BAD source without assuming the desired
common-two witness. One potential route is a genuine *dual-radix
renormalization invariant*, not another fixed-prefix classifier or
density-zero conclusion. The exact first unproved implication is
the global valuation-vs-automaton exclusion for all L, or a weaker
version restricted to R=4^K.

## 6. Verification boundary

- Fully proved: exact **all-K>=13 physical binary/ternary scale gap**
  and strict cutoff, via Lean kernel.
- Reproduced only on finite range: high-valuation automaton exclusion
  for 10<=L<=240.
- **Not proved**: the all-L binary-valuation survivor exclusion.
- **Not proved**: the original universal `gst_four_power_third_wave_gate`.
- Production `Solution.lean` still has the explicit hGate argument.
- The legacy comparator `scripts/comparator.sh` cannot certify
  an unconditional final theorem unless the binder-free theorem type
  and full kernel axiom dependencies are checked separately.

This is a substantive, source-exact new mathematical route and
an audited checkpoint, **not a completed proof of Erdős 406**.
