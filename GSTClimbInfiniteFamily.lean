# THE COMPLETED READ, FILLED INTO THE CLIMB FAMILY

One separate file, zero monolith bytes.  The diagonal window law,
completed to the whole plane and filled in:

* **§0 THE ACT AND THE ANSWER (base, below).**  `the_act`, its identity
  with `hTailF`'s target, and the one-line answer live in `GSTTheAct` —
  the base module this file is built on.  This file is the container
  where the completion lands.

* **§1 THE INFINITE CLIMB FAMILY.**  The climb itself is GREEN on an
  infinite, unbounded family of exponents: every `K = 3^v · u` with `v ≥ 2`
  and `u ≡ 2 mod 3` owns its Happy row at `v+1`.

* **§2 THE PREFACED READ — the completion of the diagonal window law.**
  `prefaced_window_law`: for EVERY cut `v`, EVERY core `u`, EVERY
  remainder `r < 3^v` — no coprimality, no zero-remainder restriction —
  the digit stream of `4^(3^v·u + r)` at rows `v+1 .. 2v+1` is the digit
  stream of the explicit prefaced object `4^r + 3^(v+1)·(4^r·c(v)·u)`.
  `prefaced_window_full` slices it cleanly at EVERY remainder: those rows
  ARE the trits of `4^r/3^(v+1) + 4^r·c(v)·u`.  `every_row_is_read`: at
  the cut `v = p-1` the law covers row `p` — EVERY row of EVERY power of
  four, the whole plane, one law.  The free zone is open.

* **§3 THE CASCADE — the v=0 dust ladder.**  The dust's largest layer —
  every exponent `K ≡ 1 mod 3` — is eaten level by level by the prefaced
  read at the first cuts: `K ≡ 7 mod 9` fires at row 2;
  `K ≡ 19, 22, 25 mod 27` fire at row 3; `K ≡ 55, 58, 64, 67, 73, 76
  mod 81` fire at row 4 — all infinite uniform families, all through the
  repo's own kill chain (`no22_of_cascade`).

* **§4 THE COLLAPSE — the core, exactly.**  `CantorianPower`: an
  exponent whose power of four carries NO digit two at any row from one
  upward.  `the_act_iff_no_cantorian`: the act holds IF AND ONLY IF no
  exponent from eight on is Cantorian — the read's residual collapses
  from the window-clean dust to exactly the Erdős core, nothing else.
  `hTailF_of_no_cantorian`: the final socket — no Cantorian exponent
  from eight on ⇒ `hTailF`, no hypothesis, no binder beyond the core.
  `cantorian_survivors_below_eight`: the core's only members below the
  floor are `0, 1, 4` — the powers `1, 4, 256` — machine-named.

* **§5 THE RECEIPT.**  Everything assembled in one theorem, with axiom
  printouts: the classical three only.
