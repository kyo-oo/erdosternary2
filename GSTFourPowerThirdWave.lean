# The Third Wave: band reformulation of the four-power direct existence law

This file is the Lean core of the third-wave analysis produced by the
six-agent strike on the legacy production boundary
`gst_four_power_direct_existence_inline`.

## The reformulation

For every row `p`, write `b := 4^K % 3^p` for the prefix of `4^K` below
row `p`.  Multiplication by four acts on row `p` by the carry law

    digit3 (4 * R) p = (4 * digit3 R p + c) % 3,   c := 4 * (R % 3^p) / 3^p ≤ 3,

so a row-`p` digit two of `4^K` survives the passage to `4^(K+1)` exactly
when the prefix `b` lies in the outer quarter bands

    prefixBand K p :=  4 * b < 3^p   ∨   3 * 3^p ≤ 4 * b.

Consequently the direct existence law is *equivalent* to the statement that
every exponent `K ≥ 5`, `K ≠ 7`, has some row `p ≥ 1` whose row digit is
two while its prefix lies in the outer quarter band — the gate predicate of
the third wave.  This file proves that equivalence unconditionally, with
no unproven assertion of any kind.

## Research record of the strike (not discharged here)

The six-agent strike established, outside this file:

* the exponent trie `K mod 3^p ↦ 4^K mod 3^(p+1)` is a bijection onto the
  principal units (the residue files carry the exact period law
  `pow4_digit_period` and the LTE identity `pow4_three_power_lte_exact`);
* at each trie level the new row digit can be steered freely by the
  exponent trit (`pow4_exponent_trit_lift_digit`), so the gate structure is
  a self-similar walk on the prefix value;
* the set of exponent classes dodging every gate grows geometrically at
  rate ≈ 2.48 per level against 3 per level of the trie, and the measured
  exception set is exactly `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7}`.

Closing the final step — that no natural exponent `K ≥ 8` follows a
gate-dodging walk forever — is the open boundary that the legacy
declaration was holding.  It is deliberately NOT asserted here.
